# JATE Text Editor
  
## Description

This is an application using webpack which shows the user a basic text editor for notes. It does change color if javascript is included in the editor. If the IndexedDB fails to connect, it will fall back onto local storage to retreive information for the user. 

When the user clicks the "install" button, the editor will open in a different window. This can only be initiated once.
